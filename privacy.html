                        <p class="mb-4">Our philosophy is simple: we believe your data is your own. We are committed to data minimization principles and do not collect, store, or process personal information through our applications. Our applications are designed to function with minimal data collection, and we do not require personal information such as names, email addresses, birthdates, credit card information, or any other personally identifiable information to operate.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>What We Do Not Collect:</strong> Our applications do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. We do not collect names, email addresses, birthdates, credit card information, payment details, location data, device identifiers that can be linked to individuals, or any other personally identifiable information. We do not use cookies, web beacons, or similar tracking technologies for advertising, analytics, or cross-app tracking purposes.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Technical Data Collection:</strong> To provide online functionality, software updates, and version control, our applications may collect and process the following non-personally identifiable technical information:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 mb-4">
                            <li><strong>Application Identifier (App ID):</strong> Our applications may generate and utilize an anonymous, non-personally identifiable application identifier. This App ID is a technical identifier used solely for the purposes of facilitating online multiplayer experiences, managing software updates, and maintaining version control. The App ID cannot be used to identify you personally and is not linked to any personal information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Player State Data:</strong> For applications with online or multiplayer functionality, we may temporarily process player state information (such as game progress, scores, or in-game status) to enable the online experience. This data is used exclusively for real-time gameplay functionality and is not stored permanently or used for any other purpose beyond enabling the immediate online session.</li>
                            <li><strong>Version Control Information:</strong> Our applications may transmit version and build information to ensure compatibility and to deliver appropriate software updates. This technical metadata is used solely for update management and version control purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Data:</strong> Any data generated or used by our applications (e.g., game saves, settings, user-created content) is stored locally on your own device. We do not have access to this information, and it is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Website Contact Form:</strong> The only personal data we collect is the information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name and email address, when you use the contact form on our website. This is used exclusively to respond to your inquiry and is processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> Our website does not use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or similar tracking technologies for advertising, analytics, or cross-app tracking purposes. We do not engage in cross-app tracking or share data with third-party advertising networks. Any cookies used are strictly limited to essential site functionality and are not used to track your behavior across websites or applications.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">In accordance with data minimization principles and applicable privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other applicable data protection laws, we process information only as necessary for the specified purposes.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Technical Data Usage:</strong> The technical data we process (App ID, player state, and version information) is used exclusively for the following legitimate business purposes:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 mb-4">

This processing is necessary for the performance of the service contract between you and us.

                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Contact Form Information:</strong> Information collected from the contact form (name and email address) is used solely to respond to your comments, questions, and provide customer service. This processing is based on your consent, which you provide by voluntarily submitting the contact form.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Technical data (App ID, player state, version information) is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the service. Player state data is typically processed in real-time and not stored permanently. App ID and version information may be retained for the duration of your use of the application to maintain service continuity. Contact form information is retained only as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry and comply with legal obligations.</p>
